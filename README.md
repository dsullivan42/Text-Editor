# Text-Editor

For this activity, we created a text editor, by which we are able to create notes, and store them, regardless on on if we have internet connection or not. We utilize the plugins and the database methods that we've learned throughout the unit, in order to create this application, by which we can access on the browser, or through a installed version, fromw which we can access with the install button at the top left, on the nav bar. We added both a put, and a get method for the db that we created. So that we are able to write and read data, from the database.
